## Install

### Prerequisites
Only if you need bill of exchange postings. They are not supported by BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST, and for me, the simplest way to do it's using a BDC with [ZCL_BC_BCD](https://github.com/EsperancaB/sap_project_object/tree/master/UTILITIES/ZCL_BC_BDC). 
If you don't want install it, only have to do is remove (or comment) method ZCL_SIMPLE_ACC_POST->BDC_POST.
